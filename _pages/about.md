## Biography
My name is Yingtao Luo (Ying-Tao Luo, 罗颖韬). I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Information System (on track with the joint Ph.D. degree in Machine Learning and Public Policy with Heinz College and Machine Learning Department) at Carnegie Mellon University fully supported by the Presidential Fellowship and the CMLH Translational Fellowship in Digital Health from CMU. At Heinz college, I am mainly advised by [Prof. Rema Padman](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-research/profiles/padman-rema) to work on sequential decision-making agent for heart failure problem and data, with the guidance and help from [Prof. Reza Skandari](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/r.skandari) and [Prof. Arman Kilic](https://providers.muschealth.org/sc/charleston/arman-kilic-md). At MLD, I am working on foundation models & contextualized treatment simulation methodology in the [SAILING Lab](https://sailing-lab.github.io/) of [Prof. Eric P. Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/). Before joining CMU, I primarily work with [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) at Tsinghua University, [Prof. Qiang Liu](https://john-qiangliu.tech/) at CASIA and many other wonderful people. I also worked at Damo Academy of Alibaba and Microsoft Research Asia for research intern. 

Truly grateful for all the great people from whom I learn a lot and get a lot of support. 

## Methodology Interest
Decision Making: Learning agent that collaborates with experts to make clinical decisions.  
Foundation Model: Solution to critical scientific problems such as single-cell modeling.  
Bio-Physics Encoding: Understanding of the first-principle human knowledge for AI models.  

## Domain Interest
Health, Science (scientific basis for health).

## Statement
There are other interesting directions I have tried in the past, but now I am "all in" Interests mentioned above. I am more attracted to real-world impact and how people's lives can be improved directly (one of the reasons I quit physics, alas), while truly enjoying exposing myself to core ML theory. I am generally open to collaboration and enjoy working with talented people I have met so far. 

## Skillset
Mostly about core ML (statistics, convex optimization, graphical model, reinforcement learning, etc.) and coding with Pytorch and CUDA, but also have the pleasure to learn human decision bias and utility theory from Ph.D.-level economics courses to aid my research.
