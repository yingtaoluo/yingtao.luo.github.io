## Biography
My name is Yingtao Luo (Ying-Tao Luo, 罗颖韬). I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Information System at Carnegie Mellon University fully supported by the Presidential Fellowship and the CMLH Translational Fellowship in Digital Health from CMU. At Heinz college, I am mainly advised by [Prof. Rema Padman](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-research/profiles/padman-rema) to work on sequential decision-making agent for heart failure. I may be on track with the joint Ph.D. degree with the machine learning department from this semester if I am lucky and am working on foundation models & contextualized treatment simulation in the [SAILING Lab](https://sailing-lab.github.io/) of [Prof. Eric P. Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/). Before joining CMU, I primarily work with [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) at Tsinghua University, [Prof. Qiang Liu](https://john-qiangliu.tech/) at CASIA and many other wonderful people. I also worked at Damo Academy of Alibaba and Microsoft Research Asia for research intern. 

Truly grateful for all the great people from whom I learn a lot and get a lot of support. 

## Methodology Interest
Decision Making: Learning Agent that collaborates with experts to make clinical decisions.  
Foundation Model: Solution to critical scientific problems such as single-cell modeling.  
Bio-Physics Encoding: Understanding of the first-principle human knowledge for AI models.  

## Domain Interest
Health, Science (scientific basis for health) and [Science of Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aao0185).

## Statement
There are other interesting directions I have tried in the past, but now I am "all in" Interests mentioned above. I am more attracted to real-world impact and how people's lives can be improved directly (one of the reasons I quit physics, alas), while truly enjoying exposing myself to core ML theory. I am generally open to collaboration and enjoy working with talented people I have met so far. 

## Skillset
Mostly about core ML (statistics, convex optimization, graphical model, reinforcement learning, etc.) and coding with Pytorch and CUDA, but also have the pleasure to learn human decision bias [(behavioral econ)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8nyQzDsAAAAJ) and utility theory from Ph.D.-level economics courses to aid my research.
